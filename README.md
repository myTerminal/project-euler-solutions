My solutions to ProjectEuler problems in different programming languages
(in continuation to [project-euler-solutions-legacy](https://github.com/myTerminal/project-euler-solutions-legacy))

## Programming languages

1. [Rust](rust)

## Running a solution

In order to run a solution to a particular problem in a particular language, use the `run` command as:

    run <language> <problem-number>

where `language` should be one of the names mentioned above, in small-case and `problem-number` should be a three-digit problem number padded by `0`s.

For example, in order to run the solution to problem number 1 in Rust, you can run:

    run rust 001
