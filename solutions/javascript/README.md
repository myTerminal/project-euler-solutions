# [JavaScript](http://www.ecmascript.org)

> **JavaScript (JS)** is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

**Note:** These solutions are imported from [project-euler-solutions-legacy](https://github.com/myTerminal/project-euler-solutions-legacy) with minimal tweaks to code to use newer constructs and almost no change to the approach of the solution itself. Though I spent much time reshaping the code for every single imported solution file, it may still not reflect my current coding style and practices.

## Dependencies
